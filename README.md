# TimeTrackingApp

An Android App that allows the user to track how much time they spend on given activities. This is achieved by letting the user create different time trackers, each with a specified label, that they can enable/disable at any time.
A time tracker stores the amount of time that has already passed, a target amount of time the user wants to reach, and whether it's enabled or disabled (A log that stores the periods of time when the tracker was active is currently being added).
While a tracker is active, it will increase its stored amount of time.
